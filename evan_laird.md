### EXPERIENCE:
---

**Google** *Cambridge, MA*
**Software Engineer** *Februray 2017-Present*

**Vermont Information Processing** *Colchester, VT*

**iOS Software Engineer**	*February 2013-August 2016*

Architecture, research/design, development, maintenance of business-oriented,
universal iOS application for use with VIP route accounting software.
Development included FTP using libcurl, socket programming (AsyncSocket), custom
UI, Core Data, Keychain Services, printing/emailing invoices and orders using
custom PDF generation engine. Upgraded networking from a mixture of hand-rolled
NSURLConnection subclasses and ASIHTTPRequest to AFNetworking, leveraging the
Objc runtime in places to avoid boilerplate code and improve safe execution.
Extensive use of gcd's threading capabilities, including background I/O and
modernizing managed object context hierarchies. Personally re-designed
sub-application for paging UI memory usage. Worked closely with QA to structure
and automate test suite (cron/bash, Appium, Sauce Labs), and contributed data
integrity scripts (Python). Built source control server (CentOS) and converted
svn repositories (auth over LDAP) to git repositories, with ssh authentication
and gitolite authorization.

**University of Vermont**	*Burlington, VT*

**Research Assistant** *September 2011-December 2012*

Work study position with focus on the research, planning/designing, fabrication,
and testing of organic photovoltaic cells (solar cells). Self-guided research of
modern fabrication techniques from multiple materials science publications.
Designed and blueprinted an aluminum testing station to handle delicate
prototypes. Operated and instructed others on the use of a vacuum chamber and
heating elements used to deposit photovoltaic layers onto substrates. Data
collection of I-V curves using electrometers and MATLAB interface program.
Designed and built a custom GUI (MATLAB) to aid students with curve-fitting
data, allowing for faster profiling of design techniques. Output from this
research was geared mainly toward developing a lab for undergraduates. Presented
the lab and demonstrated use of all hardware. Maintained lab hardware and
software.

**University of Vermont** *Burlington, VT*

**Computational Physics Research Project** *September 2012-December 2012*

Senior level course in computational physics focusing on large research project
for grade. Researched and modeled the Ising model of magnetization in a 2-D
lattice. Written in Python, utilizing NumPy and SciPy for runtime and matplotlib
for data visualization. Final result featured a command-line utility
capable of building arbitrarily-sized lattices and modeling them in
thermal equilibrium for a given amount of Monte-Carlo time for a given
temperature range. Use of the multiprocessing library achieved
number-of-cores times speedup and sidestepped the GIL problem. Extensive use
of PRNG, system calls, and file I/O. Pipelining was achieved by a module of
analyzers, designed to operate on data after modeling, with an easily
extensible interface for probing any desired metrics on the results of any
simulation. Project design included an internal coordinated metadata
structure, designed for use in matrix-type data consumption.

**The Ice Cream Company**	*West Chester, PA*

**Assistant Manager**	*August 2008-August 2012*

Ran both front and back ends of the store's operations. Handled opening and
closing of the store, including end-of-day finances. Helped plan inventory for
upcoming weeks while considering constraints on budgets, menus, storage space,
food expiration dates, and allowing for occasional emptying of freezer for
cleaning/maintenance.

**University of Vermont**	*Burlington, VT*

**B.S. Physics, minors in Mathematics and Music**	*September 2009-December 2012*

UVM Society of Physics Students president (Sept. 2012-Dec. 2012). Crafted and
ratified the SPS constitution and designed the infrastructure for it to become
an autonomous, profitable entity of the UVM physics department.
